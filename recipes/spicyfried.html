    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into 10 pieces</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 quart buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        Sprinkle chicken pieces with salt and pepper; place them in a deep-sided baking dish.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whisk buttermilk, hot pepper sauce, and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper together in a large bowl; pour over chicken, tossing to coat all sides. 
        Cover the dish with plastic wrap; marinate in the refrigerator for about 2 hours.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remove chicken from buttermilk mixture; shake off excess. Discard remaining buttermilk mixture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Place flour, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag; shake well to combine. 
        Place 2 or 3 pieces of chicken at a time into the plastic bag and shake well to coat chicken pieces with seasoned flour.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        Gently place chicken pieces into hot oil and fry until chicken is cooked through and golden brown, about 8 to10 minutes for breasts and wings, and 13 to 15 minutes for thighs and drumsticks. 
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drain fried chicken on paper towels
