    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My family loves a lot of flavor and spice in our food and jambalaya delivers. 
        This is my version of a New Orleans jambalaya that's got a nice kick to it but not overly hot for those whose tongues can't handle it.
    </p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        Melt margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in onion, celery, and green pepper; cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Pour in diced tomatoes, chicken broth, and rice; season with basil, garlic, pepper, hot sauce, and bay leaf. 
        Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then turn heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is done, about 20 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once the rice has cooked, stir in chicken, sausage, and shrimp. Simmer for a few minutes until heated through. Remove bay leaf before serving.
